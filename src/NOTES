Function overloading :

Same class have multiple methods with the same name called function overloading. But they are differed with argumets used
Rules : Either args count should be different or args type should be different

In real time it will be helpfull. For example in the ecommerce website while we are purchasing item we click on payment.
That time it will call getpayment method.
There will be different types of payment methods say debitcard, creditcard etc. these all are the args of getpayment methos.
getpayment(debitcard), getpayment(creditcard) etc etc
